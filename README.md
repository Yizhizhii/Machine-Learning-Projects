# Tongji University's Fall Semester 2023 Machine Learning Course Project ✨✨
We completed projects in three areas: *regression prediction*, *supervised learning classification* and *unsupervised clustering*:

- **Project 01**, we manually implemented a simple linear regression algorithm model and conducted a longitudinal comparison of various existing machine learning methods to predict car prices. (Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction/data). 

- **Project 02**, we used techniques such as *Bag of Words*, *TF-IDF*, and *word (sentence) vectorization* to extract text features, and constructed multiple machine learning models, such as *SVM* and *Logistic Regression*, for sentiment classification tasks. Additionally, we explored and optimized deep learning models such as *RNN*, *LSTM* and *BERT*, focusing on the interpretability of the models (Dataset source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion). 

- **Project 03** aimed to explore and evaluate the application effects of different text clustering techniques on real-world datasets. We applied various models like *TF-IDF*, *GloVe*, *Doc2Vec* and *Transformers* to extract text features, followed by unsupervised clustering using *K-Means* and *hierarchical clustering* methods.
